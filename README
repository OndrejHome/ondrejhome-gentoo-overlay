=== OndrejHome Gentoo overlay ===
Software that I use and that doesn't have (yet) the needed features or versions in standard gentoo portage tree.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! NOT EXTENSIVELY TESTED.

- app-admin/ansible-lint
  - version 4.1.*, 4.3.0
- app-emulation/fast-vm
  - release version of fast-vm
- sys-cluster/fence-virt
  - from version 1.0.0 there are proper systemd unit file and init file
- sys-cluster/corosync-3.*
  - dependency for >=sys-cluster/pacemaker-2.0
- sys-cluster/pacemaker-2.*
  - Pacemaker 2.* minimal

  - copy of https://data.gpo.zugaina.org/kaa/sys-apps/mmc-utils/

To add this repo you can use following commands that will download overlay definition
into /etc/portage/repos.conf/ directory. Note that you will need to have installed
the 'dev-vcs/git' to be able to download this overlay.

# mkdir /etc/portage/repos.conf/
# curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OndrejHome/ondrejhome-gentoo-overlay/master/ondrejhome-overlay.conf > /etc/portage/repos.conf/ondrejhome-overlay.conf
# emaint sync --repo ondrejhome
