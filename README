=== OndrejHome Gentoo overlay ===
Software that I use and that doesn't have (yet) the needed features or versions in standard gentoo portage tree.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! NOT EXTENSIVELY TESTED.

List of available packages (and why they are here):
- app-emulation/libguestfs
  - version containing 'selinux-relabel' command
- app-emulation/libguestfs-appliance
  - dependency of never app-emulation/libguestfs
- app-emulation/fast-vm
  - release version of fast-vm
- sys-cluster/fence-virt
  - dirty build of fence-virtd (no service/unit files), it just compiles
- sys-cluster/kronosnet
  - dependency for >=sys-cluster/corosync-3.0
- sys-cluster/corosync-3.*
  - dependency for >=sys-cluster/pacemaker-2.0
- sys-cluster/pacemaker-2.*
  - Pacemaker 2.* minimal

To add this repo you can use following commands that will download overlay definition
into /etc/portage/repos.conf/ directory. Note that you will need to have installed
the 'dev-vcs/git' to be able to download this overlay.

# mkdir /etc/portage/repos.conf/
# curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OndrejHome/ondrejhome-gentoo-overlay/master/ondrejhome-overlay.conf > /etc/portage/repos.conf/ondrejhome-overlay.conf
# emaint sync --repo ondrejhome
