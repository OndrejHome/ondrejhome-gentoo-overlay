Software that I use and that doesn't have (yet) the needed features or versions in standard gentoo portage tree.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! NOT EXTENSIVELY TESTED.

List of available packages (and why they are here):
- app-emulation/libguestfs
  - version containing 'selinux-relabel' command
- app-emulation/libguestfs-appliance
  - dependency of never app-emulation/libguestfs
